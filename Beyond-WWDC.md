> “In what ways have you considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others?” ― Apple

In my third semester at university, I held a tutorial for the introductory course on programming. Seeing what students just learning to code struggled with and being able to help them understand it was a great experience that I am hoping to experience again.

I actively read the Swift mailing list and got many great ideas off of it. I am hoping to contribute my own ideas in the near future.

Starting May 1st, I will be working as a research assistant at the Institute of Theoretical Informatics here in Karlsruhe. We are planning to edit my bachelor thesis on "Minimizing Potential Energy in Constrained Physical Systems and Applications to Graph Drawing" such that it can be submitted to the 25th International Symposium on Graph Drawing & Network Visualization.

On a more personal level, I am a big fan of Swift Playgrounds, especially the iPad application of the same name. I like to show some of the interactive playgrounds to friends and family who are wondering what I do. Their response has been widely positive.
